cypher.lang
===========

[Gedit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedit) syntax highlighting for the cypher query language.

### Usage

Put `cypher.lang` in `/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/` or in `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/`
and all files ending with `.cql` or `.cypher` will get syntax highlighting.

### Improvements

Documentation on editing `.lang` can be found here: https://developer.gnome.org/gtksourceview/stable/lang-tutorial.html.
Feel free to raise an issue if you think cypher.lang can be improved somehow.
